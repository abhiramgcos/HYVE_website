 HYVE
OVERVIEW


--- PAGE 3 ---
HYVE 2026 marks the inaugural season of what is envisioned
as an annual flagship technology festival at Providence
College of Engineering. Designed to foster technical
excellence and competitive spirit, HYVE creates an
environment where students move beyond theoretical
learning and engage directly with real-world engineering
challenges.
Over two immersive days, the campus transforms into a vibrant
technology ecosystem. Coding arenas, robotics showcases,
competitive gaming tournaments, innovation challenges, and
industry-led workshops operate simultaneously, creating an
atmosphere of intensity, collaboration, and discovery.
Beyond competitions, HYVE expands into experiential
domains with a professional RC Show by Torque7Racing, an
EV Expo highlighting advancements in electric mobility, a
robotics exhibition demonstrating applied automation, and a
vintage bike showcase celebrating mechanical legacy.
Curated food partners and interactive experience zones
ensure the event is both technically enriching and culturally
engaging.
HYVE is built not just as an event, but as a platform — one that
will scale in participation, partnerships, and industry
integration with each successive season.
